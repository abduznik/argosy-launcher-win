# Argosy Desktop Launcher

**Argosy** is a lightweight, portable Windows game launcher designed to bridge the gap between your local emulators and a **RomM** server. It features automated cloud save syncing, portable emulator management, and a unified library interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Cloud Save Syncing**: Automatically pulls your latest saves from RomM before you play and pushes changes back to the cloud as soon as you close the emulator.
-   **Universal "PLAY" Button**: One-click to sync, launch, and track your games across PCSX2, Dolphin, Yuzu/Eden, RetroArch, and more.
-   **Portable Emulator Management**: Download and manage the latest versions of your favorite emulators directly through the app. Supports "Portable Mode" automatically.
-   **BIOS / Firmware Rescue**: Search and download required BIOS files directly from your RomM library or firmware index.
-   **Library Search & Filtering**: Instantly find games by name or console platform.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1.  **Download**: Grab the latest `Argosy.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/abduznik/argosy-launcher-win/releases) page.
2.  **Setup**: On the first run, enter your RomM host URL and credentials.
3.  **Configure Paths**:
    -   Go to the **Emulators** tab.
    -   Set your **ROM Path** (where your games are stored).
    -   Set your **Emu Path** (where you want emulators to be installed).
4.  **Sync & Play**: Click on any game in your library and hit **▶ PLAY**. Argosy will handle the rest!
